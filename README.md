# React Todo

Something I created to get used to CRA (Create React App)

My website uses nodejs, ensure you have that installed first.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn
```

or 

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development

```bash
$ yarn start
```

or

```bash
$ npm start
```


## Testing

Run unit tests for files changes since last commit.  Watches for changes to files.
```bash
$ yarn test
```
